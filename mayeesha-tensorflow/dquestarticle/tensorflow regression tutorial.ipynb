A computational graph is simply a series of tensorflow operations chained into a graph structure where the later operations may/may not depend on the first operations.All tensorflow programs can be divided into two parst conceptually, 'building the computational graph' and \"running the computational graph\". The nodes of the graph are the mathematical operations.The edges indicate which tensors go into a node and which tensor comes out after the operation. Each operation takes 0 or more tensors as input and produces a tensor as an output or does some computation depending on the definition of the operation.\n",

    "To summarize, we have used two regression ```estimators``` here. First one is a linear model and the second one is a neural network model. For using them we have done some data cleaning in the beginning. Then we defined the feature columns and instantiated the model. For training the models we called the ```fit``` method and fed the data to the model using an input function. After that we evaluated the model with the ```evaluate``` method and visualized the predictions. We have also learnt how to visualize the loss and the models using Tensorboard.\n",
